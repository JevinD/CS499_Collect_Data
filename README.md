This code was made through jupyter notebook with the tweepy api.

The CSV file in the REPO was generated using this source code.

The CSV contains an ID for every tweet. The exact time the tweet was created. The current number of likes on each post and the ammount of times the post was retweeted. I also included tweet.text which is just the text of what was posted. The last thing could be useful in determining if likes have a correlation to the contents of a tweet ex. Humor, etc.
